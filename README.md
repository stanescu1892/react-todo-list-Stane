To-Do List App with Firebase Authentication, React Context, and React Bootstrap This is a to-do list app built with React, React Bootstrap, Firebase Authentication, and Sass. It provides users with a convenient and secure way to manage their tasks, with the added benefit of being able to log in with their Google account through Firebase Authentication.

In addition to these technologies, the app also utilizes React Context to manage state and pass data between components. This makes it easier to keep track of the current user and their to-do list, and ensures that the data is always up-to-date and consistent.

Getting Started To launch the app, simply clone the repository and run npm start in your terminal. This will start the app on your local server, and you can then view it in your web browser.

Features One of the key features of this app is the ability to change the status of each task. Tasks can be marked as "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done," and this helps users keep track of their progress and prioritize their work.

Another important feature is the ability to log in with your Google account through Firebase Authentication. This ensures that users' to-do lists are always accessible and secure, and it also provides a convenient way to save their tasks and access them from any device.

The app is built with React Bootstrap, which provides a set of pre-built components that make it easy to create a polished, professional-looking interface. Additionally, Sass is used to streamline the styling process and ensure consistency throughout the app.

Finally, React Context is used to manage state and data throughout the app. This provides a centralized way to manage the current user and their tasks, and ensures that the data is always up-to-date and consistent.
